# Sign Up Form
Sign Up Page Project. This registration page includes on-the-fly input validation.

What I learned while working on the project:

- Better understanding of Viewport Height / Width
- Using the style margin: 0 can get rid of unwanted space around elements.
- How to use some bootstrap styling
- Instead of putting the script tag at the end of the body, I should instead put it at the top and add **defer** to the end of the tag. 
    - (This didn't work this time for some reason, but it is good to know for future reference.)
- Min-Height css property can be used to keep the webpage and its elements from shrinking after the window is resized.

Frameworks and Libraries Used

- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- jQuery Validation
